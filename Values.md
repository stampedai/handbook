# Stamped Core Values

We haven't written down any values yet. We feel like it's too early to do so. Instead, we prefer to live, grow and experiment for a while and then, sit down and come up with what seems right.

Each person reading this will be part in crafting those values. For example you might bring a live-simply, frugal mindset. Someone else might contribute to a prototype and iterate fast work style. It's clich√©, but an organization really is the sum of its constituents. Everyone has an impact, especially at such an early stage.
