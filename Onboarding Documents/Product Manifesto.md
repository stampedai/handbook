# Product Manifesto

We're rethinking a century-old process. Stamped exists because our industry has had a hard time catching up with innovation. Let's always remember that.

Therefore **at Stamped, our core product value is clarity.**

Prioritizing clarity means that Stamped will always be accessible and unscary for our users. It empowers them to feel in control of the verification process. Clarity doesn't mean simplicity, but it's often related. Often, the challenge in designing experiences is finding what to leave out, not what to add.

Clarity requires deep empathy and constant refinement. It does not always make Stamped faster or safer, but instead, has a positive impact on the way our users *feel*. This positive feeling is the key to our success, both as a team and a company, and itâ€™s what we should strive for every time we ship something new.

As a product owner, it is important to understand the tricky balance between getting it right and getting it out the door. Your goal is to help your team ship the right product to users. You are a team leader, not the "CEO of the product".
